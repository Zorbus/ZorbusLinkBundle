ZorbusLinkBundle
================

This Symfony2 bundle offers a doctrine entity to manipulate information associated to links.

A link can be seen as a reference to another page or resource. A link can be associated to a category.

Besides the entity, it includes classes to integrate with the SonataAdminBundle and with the ZorbusBlockBundle.
